Welcome to my home page! My name is Linwei Ding. I am a graduate student in the School of Arts, Nanjing University. I Graduated from Xiamen University in 2022 with double degrees in art and management, major in musicology and accounting. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on art communication and media culture, musicology and sound cultural study, and digital platform culture. As a mixed method researcher, I use qualitative methods such as ethnography into the society's culture phenomenon, along with data analysis methods.

Personal Skills
======
I am good at new media operation, and I have plentiful experience in art institution operation and event planning. I have both statistical software data analysis capabilities and professional skills in financial management and accounting.
