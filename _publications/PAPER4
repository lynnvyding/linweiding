Abstract: As a significant space for aesthetic education practice, museums are presented in the form of ‘Hypermedia’ in the digital age, constructing a brand-new field where reality and the cloud are connected. With the help of short video media technology, museum aesthetic education practice has gained an opportunity to achieve breakthroughs and innovations on TikTok. Relying on the public museum accounts, the official aesthetic education narrative has established a knowledge dissemination framework that conforms to contemporary logic in terms of perspective, discourse, and structure, realizing a breakthrough that is different from traditional offline narratives, and providing audiences with an immersive aesthetic education experience. Relying on the we-media accounts, the folk aesthetic education narrative is endowed with the right of knowledge production, transformation, and innovation, establishing advantages on content affordance and socializing affordance, and creating a platform of participatory aesthetic education. However, the practice of museum aesthetic education on TikTok is still in dilemma, one is the solidification of the audience, and the other is the Matthew effect faced by the subject of folk narratives.
